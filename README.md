Student ID: [984]
Submission Date: [8/14/2025] 

# Data Warehousing

Synthetic Data Generation
Size: ~[1000] rows, [8] columns
Key Features: InvoiceNo, StockCode, Description, Quantity, InvoiceDate, UnitPrice, CustomerID, Country
Generation Method: [If synthetic: Used pandas and random/faker libraries with seed=[123] for reproducibility]

# Data Mining

Built-in Iris Dataset from scikit-learn
Description: Classic iris flower classification dataset 
Size: 150 samples, 4 features, 3 classes
Features: Sepal length/width, Petal length/width, Species (setosa, versicolor, virginica)
Used numpy.random with Gaussian distributions and seed=[456]

# üèóÔ∏è Section 1: Data Warehousing (50 Marks)
# Task 1: Data Warehouse Design (15 Marks)

# Schema Type: Star Schema
Justification: [Replace with your 2-3 sentence explanation, e.g., "Star schema was chosen over snowflake schema for better query performance and simpler maintenance. The denormalized structure reduces complex joins and improves analytical query response times, which is crucial for OLAP operations."]
Components:

# Fact Table: SalesFact

Measures: sales_amount (DECIMAL), quantity (INTEGER)
Foreign Keys: customer_id, product_id, time_id


# Dimension Tables:

CustomerDim: customer_id (PK), customer_name, country, registration_date
ProductDim: product_id (PK), product_name, category, unit_price
TimeDim: time_id (PK), date, day, month, quarter, year
[LocationDim if applicable]: location_id (PK), country, region, city


## Task 2: ETL Process Implementation (20 Marks)

Data Source: [Synthetic retail data generated with faker library / UCI Online Retail dataset]
Processing Steps:

Extract: [X] rows loaded from CSV using pandas.read_csv()
Transform:

Created TotalSales = Quantity * UnitPrice
Removed 700 rows with Quantity < 0 or UnitPrice <= 0
Filtered for sales after August 12, 2024 (last year)
Generated customer summaries and time dimensions

Database Tables Created:

SalesFact: [950] records

CustomerDim: [100] unique customers

ProductDim: [200] unique products

TimeDim: [365] time records

# Task 3: OLAP Queries and Analysis (15 Marks)

Queries Implemented:

Roll-up: Total sales by country and quarter

Drill-down: Monthly sales details for [UK/specific country from your data]

Slice: Sales by product category (electronics/clothing/etc.)



# Key Insights:

UK generated highest sales with $45,000 in Q4 2024
Electronics category contributed 35% of total revenue
Clear seasonal trend with peak sales in December


# Visualization: Bar chart showing sales distribution by country

## ü§ñ Section 2: Data Mining (50 Marks)
Task 1: Data Preprocessing and Exploration (15 Marks)

Data Source: [Built-in Iris dataset from sklearn.datasets / Synthetic Gaussian clusters]
Preprocessing Steps:

Missing Values: [0 missing values found / Handled X missing values using mean imputation]
Feature Scaling: Applied Min-Max normalization to all features
Label Encoding: [Not required for built-in dataset / Applied LabelEncoder for synthetic classes]
Train-Test Split: 80/20 split (120 train, 30 test samples)


## Key Statistics:

Feature ranges: Sepal length [4.3-7.9], Sepal width [2.0-4.4], Petal length [1.0-6.9], Petal width [0.1-2.5]
Class distribution: Setosa (33%), Versicolor (33%), Virginica (33%)
Strong correlation between petal length and width (r=0.96)


# Outlier Detection: [Found X outliers in petal width using IQR method]
Files: preprocessing_iris.ipynb, iris_processed.csv, iris_train.csv, iris_test.csv, visualization images

# Task 2: Clustering (15 Marks)

Algorithm: K-Means clustering with k=[2,3,4,5] tested
Optimal k: [3] determined via elbow method and silhouette analysis
Performance Metrics:

Adjusted Rand Index: [0.85] (excellent agreement with true classes)
Silhouette Score: [0.72] (well-separated clusters)
Inertia: [25.4] for optimal k=3


# Key Findings:

Clusters effectively separated setosa from other species
Some overlap between versicolor and virginica as expected
Petal measurements were most discriminative features


# Real-world Applications: Customer segmentation, market research, species classification
Files: clustering_iris.ipynb, cluster visualizations, clustering_analysis_report.md

## Task 3: Classification and Association Rule Mining
# Part A: Classification 

Models Compared: Decision Tree vs K-Nearest Neighbors (k=5)
Performance Results:

Decision Tree:

Accuracy: [96.7]%
Precision: [0.97], Recall: [0.97], F1-Score: [0.97]
Max Depth: [3], Most Important Feature: [Petal Length]


KNN (k=5):

Accuracy: [93.3]%
Precision: [0.93], Recall: [0.93], F1-Score: [0.93]

Best Performer: [Decision Tree] due to [higher accuracy and interpretability]
Tree Visualization: Generated decision tree showing [3] levels with clear decision boundaries

## Part B: Association Rule Mining (10 Marks)

Transaction Data: [50] transactions with [20] unique items (milk, bread, beer, diapers, eggs, etc.)
Generation Method: Used random.choices with weighted probabilities to create realistic shopping patterns
Parameters: min_support=0.2, min_confidence=0.5
Rules Generated: [15] association rules found
Top Rules by Lift:

[bread, milk] ‚Üí [butter] (Support: 0.24, Confidence: 0.75, Lift: 2.1)
[diapers] ‚Üí [beer] (Support: 0.22, Confidence: 0.65, Lift: 1.8)
[eggs, milk] ‚Üí [bread] (Support: 0.26, Confidence: 0.70, Lift: 1.6)


The diapers‚Üíbeer rule suggests young parents often buy beer during diaper purchases, indicating cross-selling opportunities for retailers
