Why I chose Star schema over Snowflake
- I chose the star schema because it is simpler and easier to understand compared to the snowflake schema. All dimension tables are directly connected to the fact table, reducing the complexity of joins and improving query performance. This design also makes it easier for end users to navigate and analyze the data.
